     * Calculate the natural endpoint for the view.
     *
     * The view natural endpoint is the endpoint which has the same cardinality as this node in the replication factor.
     * The cardinality is the number at which this node would store a piece of data, given the change in replication
     * factor. If the keyspace's replication strategy is a NetworkTopologyStrategy, we filter the ring to contain only
     * nodes in the local datacenter when calculating cardinality.
     *
     * For example, if we have the following ring:
     *   {@code A, T1 -&gt; B, T2 -&gt; C, T3 -&gt; A}
     *
     * For the token T1, at RF=1, A would be included, so A's cardinality for T1 is 1. For the token T1, at RF=2, B would
     * be included, so B's cardinality for token T1 is 2. For token T3, at RF = 2, A would be included, so A's cardinality
     * for T3 is 2.
     *
     * For a view whose base token is T1 and whose view token is T3, the pairings between the nodes would be:
     *  A writes to C (A's cardinality is 1 for T1, and C's cardinality is 1 for T3)
     *  B writes to A (B's cardinality is 2 for T1, and A's cardinality is 2 for T3)
     *  C writes to B (C's cardinality is 3 for T1, and B's cardinality is 3 for T3)
     *
     * @return Optional.empty() if this method is called using a base token which does not belong to this replica
