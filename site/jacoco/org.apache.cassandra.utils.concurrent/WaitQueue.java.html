/**
 * &lt;p&gt;A relatively easy to use utility for general purpose thread signalling.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;Usage on a thread awaiting a state change using a WaitQueue q is:&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * {@code
 *      while (!conditionMet())
 *          Signal s = q.register();
 *              if (!conditionMet())    // or, perhaps more correctly, !conditionChanged()
 *                  s.await();
 *              else
 *                  s.cancel();
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * A signalling thread, AFTER changing the state, then calls q.signal() to wake up one, or q.signalAll()
 * to wake up all, waiting threads.
 * &lt;p&gt;To understand intuitively how this class works, the idea is simply that a thread, once it considers itself
 * incapable of making progress, registers to be awoken once that changes. Since this could have changed between
 * checking and registering (in which case the thread that made this change would have been unable to signal it),
 * it checks the condition again, sleeping only if it hasn't changed/still is not met.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;This thread synchronisation scheme has some advantages over Condition objects and Object.wait/notify in that no monitor
 * acquisition is necessary and, in fact, besides the actual waiting on a signal, all operations are non-blocking.
 * As a result consumers can never block producers, nor each other, or vice versa, from making progress.
 * Threads that are signalled are also put into a RUNNABLE state almost simultaneously, so they can all immediately make
 * progress without having to serially acquire the monitor/lock, reducing scheduler delay incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A few notes on utilisation:&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;1. A thread will only exit await() when it has been signalled, but this does not guarantee the condition has not
 * been altered since it was signalled, and depending on your design it is likely the outer condition will need to be
 * checked in a loop, though this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;2. Each signal is single use, so must be re-registered after each await(). This is true even if it times out.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;3. If you choose not to wait on the signal (because the condition has been met before you waited on it)
 * you must cancel() the signal if the signalling thread uses signal() to awake waiters; otherwise signals will be
 * lost. If signalAll() is used but infrequent, and register() is frequent, cancel() should still be used to prevent the
 * queue growing unboundedly. Similarly, if you provide a TimerContext, cancel should be used to ensure it is not erroneously
 * counted towards wait time.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;4. Care must be taken when selecting conditionMet() to ensure we are waiting on the condition that actually
 * indicates progress is possible. In some complex cases it may be tempting to wait on a condition that is only indicative
 * of local progress, not progress on the task we are aiming to complete, and a race may leave us waiting for a condition
 * to be met that we no longer need.
 * &lt;p&gt;5. This scheme is not fair&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;6. Only the thread that calls register() may call await()&lt;/p&gt;
