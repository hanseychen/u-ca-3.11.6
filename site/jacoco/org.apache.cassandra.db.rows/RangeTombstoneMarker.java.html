     * Utility class to help merging range tombstone markers coming from multiple inputs (UnfilteredRowIterators).
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The assumption that each individual input must validate and that we must preserve in the output is that every
     * open marker has a corresponding close marker with the exact same deletion info, and that there is no other range
     * tombstone marker between those open and close marker (of course, they could be rows in between). In other word,
     * for any {@code UnfilteredRowIterator}, you only ever have to remenber the last open marker (if any) to have the
     * full picture of what is deleted by range tombstones at any given point of iterating that iterator.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note that this class can merge both forward and reverse iterators. To deal with reverse, we just reverse how we
     * deal with open and close markers (in forward order, we'll get open-close, open-close, ..., while in reverse we'll
     * get close-open, close-open, ...).
