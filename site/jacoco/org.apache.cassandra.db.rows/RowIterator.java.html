/**
 * An iterator over rows belonging to a partition.
 *
 * A RowIterator is an UnfilteredRowIterator to which any deletion information has been
 * filtered out. As such, all cell of all rows returned by this iterator are,
 * by definition, live, and hence code using a RowIterator don't have to worry
 * about tombstones and other deletion information.
 *
 * Note that as for UnfilteredRowIterator, the rows returned must be in clustering order (or
 * reverse clustering order if isReverseOrder is true), and the Row objects returned
 * by next() are only valid until the next call to hasNext() or next().
