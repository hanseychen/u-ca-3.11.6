/**
 * An iterator over the rows of a given partition that also includes deletion informations.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An {@code UnfilteredRowIterator} contains a few partition top-level informations and is an
 * iterator of {@code Unfiltered}, that is of either {@code Row} or {@code RangeTombstoneMarker}.
 * An implementation of {@code UnfilteredRowIterator} &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; provide the following
 * guarantees:
 *   1. the returned {@code Unfiltered} must be in clustering order, or in reverse clustering
 *      order iff {@link #isReverseOrder} returns true.
 *   2. the iterator should not shadow its own data. That is, no deletion
 *      (partition level deletion, row deletion, range tombstone, complex
 *      deletion) should delete anything else returned by the iterator (cell, row, ...).
 *   3. every &quot;start&quot; range tombstone marker should have a corresponding &quot;end&quot; marker, and no other
 *      marker should be in-between this start-end pair of marker. Note that due to the
 *      previous rule this means that between a &quot;start&quot; and a corresponding &quot;end&quot; marker there
 *      can only be rows that are not deleted by the markers. Also note that when iterating
 *      in reverse order, &quot;end&quot; markers are returned before their &quot;start&quot; counterpart (i.e.
 *      &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; are always in the sense of the clustering order).
 *
 * Note further that the objects returned by next() are only valid until the
 * next call to hasNext() or next(). If a consumer wants to keep a reference on
 * the returned objects for longer than the iteration, it must make a copy of
 * it explicitly.
