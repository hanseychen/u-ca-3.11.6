/**
 * Performs garbage collection of stale index entries during a regular compaction.
 *
 * A CompactionTransaction is concerned with cleaning up stale index entries.
 * When multiple versions of a row are compacted, the CompactionTransaction is
 * notified of the versions being merged, which it diffs against the merge result.
 *
 * Instances are currently scoped to a single row within a partition, but this could be improved to batch process
 * multiple rows within a single partition.
