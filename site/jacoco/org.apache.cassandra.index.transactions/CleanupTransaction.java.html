/**
 * Performs garbage collection of index entries during a cleanup.
 *
 * Notifies registered indexers of each partition being removed and
 *
 * Compaction and Cleanup are somewhat simpler than dealing with incoming writes,
 * being only concerned with cleaning up stale index entries.
 *
 * When multiple versions of a row are compacted, the CleanupTransaction is
 * notified of the versions being merged, which it diffs against the merge result
 * and forwards to the registered Index.Indexer instances when on commit.
 *
 * Instances are currently scoped to a single row within a partition, but this could be improved to batch process
 * multiple rows within a single partition.
