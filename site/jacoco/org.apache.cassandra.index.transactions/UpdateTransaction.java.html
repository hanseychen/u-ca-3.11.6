/**
 * Handling of index updates on the write path.
 *
 * Instances of an UpdateTransaction are scoped to a single partition update
 * A new instance is used for every write, obtained from the
 * newUpdateTransaction(PartitionUpdate) method. Likewise, a single
 * CleanupTransaction instance is used for each partition processed during a
 * compaction or cleanup.
 *
 * We make certain guarantees about the lifecycle of each UpdateTransaction
 * instance. Namely that start() will be called before any other method, and
 * commit() will be called at the end of the update.
 * Each instance is initialized with 1..many Index.Indexer instances, one per
 * registered Index. As with the transaction itself, these are scoped to a
 * specific partition update, so implementations can be assured that all indexing
 * events they receive relate to the same logical operation.
 *
 * onPartitionDelete(), onRangeTombstone(), onInserted() and onUpdated()
 * calls may arrive in any order, but this should have no impact for the
 * Indexers being notified as any events delivered to a single instance
 * necessarily relate to a single partition.
 *
 * The typical sequence of events during a Memtable update would be:
 * start()                       -- no-op, used to notify Indexers of the start of the transaction
 * onPartitionDeletion(dt)       -- if the PartitionUpdate implies one
 * onRangeTombstone(rt)*         -- for each in the PartitionUpdate, if any
 *
 * then:
 * onInserted(row)*              -- called for each Row not already present in the Memtable
 * onUpdated(existing, updated)* -- called for any Row in the update for where a version was already present
 *                                  in the Memtable. It's important to note here that existing is the previous
 *                                  row from the Memtable and updated is the final version replacing it. It is
 *                                  *not* the incoming row, but the result of merging the incoming and existing
 *                                  rows.
 * commit()                      -- finally, finish is called when the new Partition is swapped into the Memtable
