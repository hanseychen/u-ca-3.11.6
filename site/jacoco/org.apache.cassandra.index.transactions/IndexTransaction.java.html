/**
 * Base interface for the handling of index updates.
 * There are 3 types of transaction where indexes are updated to stay in sync with the base table, each represented by
 * a subinterface:
 * * {@code UpdateTransaction}
 *   Used on the regular write path and when indexing newly acquired SSTables from streaming or sideloading. This type
 *   of transaction may include both row inserts and updates to rows previously existing in the base Memtable. Instances
 *   are scoped to a single partition update and are obtained from the factory method
 *   {@code SecondaryIndexManager#newUpdateTransaction}
 *
 * * {@code CompactionTransaction}
 *   Used during compaction when stale entries which have been superceded are cleaned up from the index. As rows in a
 *   partition are merged during the compaction, index entries for any purged rows are cleaned from the index to
 *   compensate for the fact that they may not have been removed at write time if the data in the base table had been
 *   already flushed to disk (and so was processed as an insert, not an update by the UpdateTransaction). These
 *   transactions are currently scoped to a single row within a partition, but this could be improved to batch process
 *   multiple rows within a single partition.
 *
 * * @{code CleanupTransaction}
 *   During cleanup no merging is required, the only thing to do is to notify indexes of the partitions being removed,
 *   along with the rows within those partitions. Like with compaction, these transactions are currently scoped to a
 *   single row within a partition, but this could be improved with batching.
