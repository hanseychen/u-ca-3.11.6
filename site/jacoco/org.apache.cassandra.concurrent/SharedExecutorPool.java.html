/**
 * A pool of worker threads that are shared between all Executors created with it. Each executor is treated as a distinct
 * unit, with its own concurrency and task queue limits, but the threads that service the tasks on each executor are
 * free to hop between executors at will.
 *
 * To keep producers from incurring unnecessary delays, once an executor is &quot;spun up&quot; (i.e. is processing tasks at a steady
 * rate), adding tasks to the executor often involves only placing the task on the work queue and updating the
 * task permits (which imposes our max queue length constraints). Only when it cannot be guaranteed the task will be serviced
 * promptly, and the maximum concurrency has not been reached, does the producer have to schedule a thread itself to perform
 * the work ('promptly' in this context means we already have a worker spinning for work, as described next).
 *
 * Otherwise the worker threads schedule themselves: when they are assigned a task, they will attempt to spawn
 * a partner worker to service any other work outstanding on the queue (if any); once they have finished the task they
 * will either take another (if any remaining) and repeat this, or they will attempt to assign themselves to another executor
 * that does have tasks remaining. If both fail, it will enter a non-busy-spinning phase, where it will sleep for a short
 * random interval (based upon the number of threads in this mode, so that the total amount of non-sleeping time remains
 * approximately fixed regardless of the number of spinning threads), and upon waking will again try to assign itself to
 * an executor with outstanding tasks to perform. As a result of always scheduling a partner before committing to performing
 * any work, with a steady state of task arrival we should generally have either one spinning worker ready to promptly respond
 * to incoming work, or all possible workers actively committed to tasks.
 *
 * In order to prevent this executor pool acting like a noisy neighbour to other processes on the system, workers also deschedule
 * themselves when it is detected that there are too many for the current rate of operation arrival. This is decided as a function
 * of the total time spent spinning by all workers in an interval; as more workers spin, workers are descheduled more rapidly.
